1. WHAT IS Jflow ?

Today biologists produce large data sets and are in demand of rich and simple 
to use WEB portals in which they can upload and analyse their files. Providing 
such tools requires to mask the complexity induced by the needed High Perfomance 
Computing (HPC) environment. The connexion between interface and computing infrastructure 
is usually specific to each portal. We introduce jflow, a Workflow Management System (WMS), 
composed of Jquery plugins which can easily be embedded in any WEB application and a 
Python library providing all requested features to setup, run and monitor workflows.
